The pilot surfaced critical insights: small-scale alignment was technically feasible, but both systems handled color overrides differently, and limited palettes constrained the flexibility our large, diverse teams needed.

But a palette without infrastructure is just a document. Both libraries used their own internal naming schemes — changing a single color meant digging through multiple files, updating each system manually, and hoping everything matched.
